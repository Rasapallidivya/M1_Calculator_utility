A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform simple mathematical operations. We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator in some situations, where we need to solve complex calculations like trigonometry functions, exponential operators, degrees, radians, log functions, hyperbolic functions etc. Let's discuss the various ways to create a calculator program in the C language.

# Different ways to create a Calculator Program in C
Following are the different ways to write a Calculator Program in the C language.

Calculator Program in C using the switch statement
Calculator Program in C using if else if statement
Calculator Program in C using do-while loop and switch statement
Calculator Program in C using function and switch statement

we can say that,This is a simple calculator created in the C programming language that runs from the DOS command prompt. All basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulus calculations, and many others, are performed by the calculator. It can also compute integer numbersâ€™ factorial, powers, and roots.
